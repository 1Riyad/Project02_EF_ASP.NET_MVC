These Slayers protect humanity from Behemoths that are consuming the land following a cataclysmic event that turned the landscape into ever-changing, floating islands.

Dauntless is playable solo, although it is designed with co-op play in mind. It boasts a variety of unique encounters and rewards players with items that will allow them to upgrade weapons and armor — enabling them to become even stronger warriors.",

                            Description = @"World of Tanks is a popular free to play multiplayer role playing team-based shooter game developed by Wargaming.net. World of Tanks is based around the middle of the 20th century, and features huge epic battles with various different game modes such as Standard, Assault, Encounter Battles, and an added bonus of 15 tanks vs 15 enemy tanks gameplay.

The game starts off with quite easy gameplay but eventuates into a more difficult game as you progress, and because a typical game only takes between 5-10 minutes the game can get quite intense as well. Unlike other games in World of Tanks you cannot respawn; so when your tank gets destroyed you tank gets destroy and you have to start a new game before you can play again. You can still watch the battlefield from a spectator but who wants to be a spectator when you can join in with action with a simple click of a button?

A different aspect of World of Tanks is that you wait in a queue called a “lobby” and then are launched into a random map, with random enemy players. In World of Tanks depending on your gaming style you start off with a fast lightly armored tank, a middle of the range type of tank, or a slower, more heavily armored tank. The tanks are based on real authentic tanks that were in World War 2. There are approximately 150 tanks from 3 different countries, these being Germany, Russia, and the United States of America.

The tank you choose can be customized by performing various different upgrades, which you can acquire through winning experience and credits you gain by winning battles against other enemy tanks. There are 10 different tiers, with tier 1 being a very weak tank going all the way up to tier 10 tanks which are the most powerful. Just like your tanks in the game your crew has a set of skills which progresses as you move through the different tiers in the game.

You can own multiple tanks but can only pilot 1 tank in any one game. Depending on what nation you choose will determine what research tree you will advance through to unlock new, more powerful tanks, weapons, and crew members to help your battles against the other enemy tanks. Since World of Tanks initial release there have been numerous updates to improve the difficulty, the visual aspects, new fresh maps, and new tanks and allow more exciting clan features of the game. If you like blowing up tanks, with a quick and intense game style you will simply love this game!",

In the distant future, war against the Grineer Empire leads humanity to summon ancient warriors from the distant past. Called “Tenno,” these agile fighters are equally skilled in blades and guns, able to carve their way through scores of enemies with skill and aplomb. A vast arsenal of these human weapons are called upon in mankind’s darkest hour to rescue their brethren from total annihilation.

As one of these Tenno, staked with protecting humanity, you’ll root out the Grineer from all their hiding places, scouring the Solar System and eliminating this nefarious threat. You’ll choose from among dozens of deadly Warframes, each with its own set of skills and strengths. The game progresses through a series of levels, each themed around a planet or region of the Solar System, and each requiring a squad of four Tenno to clear. As you advance, you’ll unlock more power for your Tenno, including new weapons and skills, letting you take on even tougher enemies.

Tenno have a number of sweet moves at their disposal, including the ability to “parkour” over and around obstacles, ziplines they can balance on, wall-latching and wall-dashing, and more. Tenno are also spiritual warriors, able to channel energy to spectacular results, including augmenting their weapon damage or activating special powers. Even when downed in battle, Tenno can continue to fight and rally to continue their missions.

Between missions, you can purchase better weapons for your Tenno or even entirely new Warframes, so you can try out a different play style. Some items cost credits (in-game currency) while others require platinum, which is purchased with real money. You can also craft your own weapons and insert mods to make them more powerful. Your ship, the Liset, is also where you’ll select your next mission, which you can choose to be public, letting anyone join you, or private, which you can attempt with a pre-selected team.

Warframe requires fast reflexes and split-second timing to execute a Tenno’s most dynamic moves. Because the game demands constant progression, and the resources required to purchase those progressions, a high skill factor is required, not only to play, but to play quickly enough to advance at a reasonable rate – and to keep up with your teammates. As such, there’s a lot of repetition required. If you want to quickly rip through content over and over, growing in power with each iteration, Warframe will suit you.",

Of course, this is a battle royale, so in addition to dealing with each other, players must contend with the ever-shrinking map.

Players can choose between seven different champions, each with a unique super power. Speaking of powers, there’s also a bit of mysticism involved, with ancient ritual, hex bags, blood magic, and more. Players can use these skills to flood the map, summon zombies, and even teleport.

Of course, it’s not all magick and powers. There are the standard weapons – all realistically modeled.These include anti-material guns, sniper rifles, Ars, rocket launchers and flamethrowers. Vehicles also have an impact on gameplay with players having access to military amphibians and speed boats.

Unlike other battle royales, CRSED: F.O.A.D offers players a choice between third and first-person view when playing. This is achieved by equipping all players with a familiar with a camera that can see players peeking around a corner. 

Previously described as an “all-kitchen-warfare battle royale game”, Cusine Royale started out as an April Fool’s joke from the developers of the MMO shooter Enlisted, and eventually took on a life of its own due to how popular it was with fans. But the new season and reboot, changes everything!

                            Description = @"Blade & Soul is a free-to-play, action combat MMORPG from NCSoft that initially released in 2012 in Korea but finally saw a Western release in January 2016. Blade & Soul is a martial arts inspired MMORPG that tasks players with learning action combat based combination attacks for each class. Currently, there are 7 classes available in the game; Assassin, Blade Master, Destroyer, Force Master, Kung-Fu Master, Summoner, and Blade Dancer. New players will want to research the classes prior to starting a new character since classes fall under various race restrictions when choosing from one of the game’s four currently available races.

Blade & Soul’s most notable feature is perhaps the game’s combat. Skills are learned as you level up and are displayed on hotbars in the traditional MMORPG style, but the actual implementation of those skills differs from most other games in the genre. While you will work with “rotations” in combat, it is perhaps better to think of these rotations in the form of “combinations” as each class will have a plethora of skills that can be combined in succession to perform very well animated combination attacks. These combinations may only be two or three buttons or they could be MUCH longer. Unlike other action combat MMOs though, Blade & Soul isn’t going to spoon feed you the combinations by hitting one key to trigger the next strike in the combination. Instead, Blade & Soul requires you to actually learn not only the combination itself, but each ability’s timing, and the required position to execute certain parts of the combination (Your hot bar actually can change based on position. i.e. being knocked down may give you access to abilities that cannot be used while standing). Learning these combination, aiming them appropriately, and reacting to incoming attacks are the key to the game’s fast paced and sometimes complex combat. If you liked TERA’s combat, you’ll probably enjoy Blade & Soul’s quite a bit.

Leveling brings the usual grind of story, side, and repeatable quests but the game’s environments change so often and are very well rendered that you won’t get bored by the scenery for quite some time. Transportaion is handled with sprint, glide, and even water walking abilities to speed up any backtracking you may have do. Instant teleports are available by spending in-game currency. Leveling requires completion of quests and along the way players will gain gear that can be upgraded along with your character. Feed equipment that you don’t need to your sword, for example, and you get a sword that levels up as your character does. This primary upgrading mechanic applies to many different gear pieces and keeps players going after loot simply to “feed” their primary equipment.

The addition of a “Soul Shield” allows for extra stat customization provided you can find the pieces of the shield you desire. Skills can be further customized at about level 18 (it’s actually a story completion point that triggers this mechanic) by spending points in your martial tome to increase ability effectiveness.

If you enjoy dungeons, Blade & Soul has quite a few options for you. Each dungeon (be it a full instance or just a cave on the world map) has numerous difficulty levels and varying party size requirements. This keeps the loot fest rolling as certain dungeons will drop the items needed to “Breakthrough” on your weapon and gear upgrading. The game’s matchmaking system makes finding a party for these runs very easy.

Blade & Soul’s PvP is based on two main categories; World PvP and Arena PvP. Arena PvP is a 1v1 or 3v3/6v6 (currently only in Korea) affair. Versus matches are simply queued for while World PvP is based on what your character is wearing. You read that right. World PvP is based on what you are wearing. It’s a creative way to “flag” for PvP. Simply donning the costume of one of the game’s 2 factions makes you able to be attacked by a member of the opposing faction out in the world. Other costumes could turn normally friendly NPCs into enemy NPCs that will attack you on sight.

Blade & Soul’s cash shop varies by geographic location but for the most part contains the normal consumables, costumes, and cosmetics. However, some materials are also available in the shop. The multiple shops actually utilize multiple currency types and a currency exchange system is in place to provide free players with a means to acquire cash shop items. A subscription service is also available and provides additional perks to players that opt for the payment.",

The Primary Objectives are things that you have to complete during the mission, with your co-op team, to successfully finish the mission. The Secondary Objectives do not have to be completed but they will offer you and your team a bigger reward if completed.

The PvP consists of two teams with 15 players each all of them using different vehicles and different classes of vehicles during the match.

You’ll pilot warplanes in exciting PvP dogfights and rumble across the battlefield in tanks, battling against foes on across several vintage maps, featuring diverse terrain and offering several strategic options. There are many different ways to play War Thunder, ranging from quick arcade mode-style combat to competitive, realistic battles.

The vehicles in War Thunder represent WWII-era tanks and planes from several different nations, including the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, and the USSR. Battles earn you currency you can use to upgrade your vehicles with better engines, weaponry, and other modifications, and you’ll also earn experience that you can use to unlock more vehicles and increase your crew’s performance. Planes include quick and agile fighters, giant flying fortresses, and precision bombers, while tanks run the gamut from light to heavy to self-propelled artillery. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and learning how to properly use your vehicles is the key to victory.

The most common game modes are PvP battles that revolve around a series of control points or that task players with destroying enemy vehicles, whether AI-controlled or belonging to other players. Each player brings a squad of up to five vehicles and, when your current vehicle is destroyed, you’ll choose another one to ride back into combat. You can also adjust battle realism, opting for simpler controls with target reticles and other helpful guides, or complete realism, with very few artificial elements in the way of aid. In addition to PvP battles, there are also PvE campaigns and missions you can take on alone or with other players. No matter how you play War Thunder, the action will be easy to find and the battles will have you on the edge of your seat!",

Building on that first game’s guiding principles, it offers a huge world to explore, populated with dynamic events that can start at any time and provide excellent variety in gameplay. It also features PvP, both open-world and instanced, dungeons, raiding, storytelling, and everything else you’d expect in a full-featured massively multiplayer online RPG.

You’ll choose from among the five races of Tyria – human, norn, charr, sylvari, and asura – and one of several classes. Each class has remarkable versatility, allowing it to fill a number of roles in a party and reducing the need for a full MMO-style “trinity.” Characters have limited skill bars of 10 slots; the first five are determined by your weapon and the second five by skills that you choose: a healing skill, three utility skills, and an elite skill. Different classes have ways to access other skills, and most classes have the ability to swap out weapons, so you’ll still have some variety in exactly what tools you can bring to each fight.

The heart of Guild Wars 2 is its open-world content. While there is some static content, in the form of “hearts” that you can complete once for NPCs, most of the game revolves around dynamic events, which spring up in the world at various times and often require large groups of players to complete. There are no traditional quests that require you to speak to NPCs to accept or complete them; instead, you can simply go from event to event, helping the people of Tyria as you see fit. Some events are parts of larger chains that string together and culminate in a giant event against a great threat to Tyria and require a hundred or more players to complete.",

While the game is free-to-play and does have some typical MMORPG elements (combat, questing, looting, etc) the primary difference between Entropia Universe and other games is the linking of a real world currency exchange.

Imagine this: you spend $10 USD to buy some in game currency. You then use that currency and your skills (like sweating monsters) to farm up items of value and triple your total in-game currency. Sounds familiar so far, right? Here’s where Entropia Universe differs though. You can exchange that in-game currency BACK into real world money whenever you want to do so at a fixed conversion rate. This means players can play their game, have some fun, and turn an actual real life profit if they work hard enough.

This primary economic mechanic had netted Entropia Universe some serious press as players buy and sell actual locations in game for hundreds of thousands of real life dollars. The game has also appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records earning titles multiple times for the most expensive virtual items ever sold.

In game, players aren’t really limited to classes. If you like combat, go for it. Want to be a surgeon? You can do that too. If you can find a way to earn money doing something, chances are that Entropia Universe will allow you to do it. If you’re looking for a slightly off the beaten path Sci-Fi MMO game and would like to take your chance at making some extra scratch, check out Entropia Universe.

This type of content can be in the form of mini-games, buildings, or various types of sims.

Players stake on the role of psychic teenagers with the ability to power special weapons called “Soul Workers,” which they will use to fight the monsters that have the vacant city of Cloudrealm. They won’t just be fighting, however, but also trying to discover what happened to the people who used to live in that city and possibly reverse it.

Players get to choose between six different Soul Worker weapons — each aligning to a different class. These are: a chainsaw, a cannon, dual swords, dual pistols, a great sword, and a scythe. More powerful weapons can be obtained via crafting. There is also a limit-break style system — the Zenith attack — in which players who have accumulated enough Soul in combat are able to perform a powerful move related to their weapon. To make things even more interesting, two players can combine attacks into a more powerful one referred to as Coordination.

Visually, the game is a 3D version of the anime it is inspired by. SoulWorker is slated for release later this year — although an exact date hasn’t been announced yet.",

Characters with high stats in specific things will be able to generate higher amounts of resources for the community. In addition, the community is grown by either waiting for new people to arrive or by pairing a male and female dweller to create children.

Players can build a wide variety of rooms for the vault dwellers to use; everything from rooms to generate resources, to training rooms, and recreational areas.

During the course of the game, even your hero itself will undergo changes, being modified by shrine cards to acquire new and more powerful skills. Heroes will also gain levels in the six aspects of magic, allowing them to cast more powerful spells as the game goes on.

Combat in Spellweaver is about more than just having bigger creatures than your opponent. In addition to their strength, creatures have a speed ability that is crucial in combat, as they can only attack or block creatures with an equal or lower speed. There are also instant spells that can be played during combat to alter the course of battles.

Another strategic feature that’s unique to Spellweaver is the two lines of combat: front and support. Creatures on the support line can’t be directly attacked, so it’s a great place to hide weak creatures with powerful abilities, so you can let your front-line creatures soak up the damage from your enemy. In addition to great cards, you’ll need plenty of tactical know-how to succeed at Spellweaver!

There are six magical aspects in Spellweaver: Order, Wisdom, Nature, Corruption, Dominion, and Rage. Each hero starts with the ability to use cards from one of the aspects but can use any of the six in their decks, depending on how they develop themselves. There are over a dozen heroes and hundreds of cards available, offering countless options for creating a deck.

Spellweaver has multiple play modes, including matches versus AI, ranked play, drafts, and tournaments, as well as massive multiplayer events. As you play, you’ll earn currency you can use to buy new packs of cards, which you can also purchase with real money. Build your collection and join the battle for Esperia today!",

Poppermost Productions released the game into an Early Access/Open beta in late January 2016 with additional developments forthcoming based on player feedback.

Currently the game offers 6 different mountains for players to explore. Each mountain has multiple faces set up for speed runs, slalom matches, and trick competitions. Mountains and their sides can have differing difficulty levels and each can be explored in a “Free Roam” mode if desired.

While the game features a cash shop, the contents of the cash shop are purely cosmetic with the exception of a few extra events that can be purchased and explored in addition to the myriad of events already available for free players. This focus on cosmetics allows SNOW to be a skill heavy game.

As of the time of this writing, SNOW does not allow any keybinding changes (although the menu has a spot for keybinding so look for it to be implemented soon) and does not support a controller so players will have to get used to some heavy finger dexterity to pull off the trickier flips, grabs, and grinds. Players familiar with the Shaun White or SSX series of games will be familiar with the core trick gameplay.

W, A, S, and D controls your character (there is currently no real customization in game except for swapping out gear) and provide speed, turning, and braking while on the ground. Get some air under you and the control scheme changes to W, A, S, andD controlling your flip and turn directions and the up, down, left, and right arrows trigger grab moves when used singly or in various combinations. Left Shift is used to put a faster rotation on your flips and turns and Space Bar is used to jump. Players can even let loose a drone to scope out the field ahead of them.

At the end of a run or event, points are converted into experience to level up your character and cash shop currency is occasionally given out as a reward for those that don’t wish to actually spend money to sport a horse head while skiing. (Yes, that horse head thing is actually an option…along with a TON of other crazy costume options.)

Be warned, SNOW takes a bit of getting used to and occasionally the physics of the game are a bit wonky. This is particularly noticeable when trying to pull of grind tricks on rails or other structures. That being said, it is funny to see your character grinding away on a rail while being stuck in an impossible position.

For skiing and snowboarding fans, SNOW is a great option in the multiplayer landscape or for those just looking for a bit of free PC fun.",

You know, a time when people were burnt at the stack for being a witch. In this version though, witchcraft and other things occult are very real and can pose quite a threat to your basic survival. And that’s what the game is mainly about: Survival. You’ll take on the role of a puritanical settler that crafts, gathers, and builds their way to a better life….well first you’ll be just trying to survive long enough to get some food, some water, and maybe a crude shelter.

While the city of Providence is a safe zone (allowing players to meet up, trade, buy items, and not have to worry about death, everything beyond its borders is wilderness that can be fully developed by players who can alter the game’s landscape permanently. Your specific character doesn’t have a pore-define role, either. Become what you want to become by mastering a plethora of skills and trades. Build things, combat threats, or hell, even dabble in a bit of Alchemy or Goat Rearing (yes, that’s a viable skill.)

Be careful though, outside the walls of Providence, anything goes. Since Salem features a permadeath mechanic, players will want to take their time before venturing too far. Skilling up a bit, discovering a few things you can make or build, and generally making some friends might be a huge boost to players right off the bat.

Salem’s art style is a bit unique and certainly won’t appeal to everyone. For the most part, the game adopts an isometric viewpoint similar to ARPGs like Path of Exile. The graphics themselves are quite simple and straight forward, even if they don’t tip the scales of realism in any way.

With innumerable materials, crafting combinations, and the challenge of in-game death ever-present, Salem offers a unique contribution to the sandbox MMORPG genre. Salem is developed by Mortal Moments and published by Paradox Interactive

Dirty Bomb’s classes work in the form of “Mercs,” mercenaries that have various skill sets that range from being able to drop turrets to calling in orbital laser strikes. Players are allowed to select multiple Mercs before a match and swap between them between deaths as needed. Currently there are three primary gameplay modes in Dirty Bomb. Objective mode challenges both team to meet various objectives on the map and the match timer has time added as each objective is met. Stopwatch mode is a variation on Objective mode except this time, each team is given a chance to both attack and then defend the objectives. The fastest time overall wins. Finally, Execution mode. This mode is straight forward: Eliminate the opposing team or blow up the objective.

Dirty Bomb’s 5 maps can support up to 8v8 gameplay and the 18 available Mercs (as of this writing) offer a fair amount of diversity, speed, abilities, and usefulness in the game. The game also features the use of a card system to augment Merc loadouts. New players will want to search out a guide for their Merc of choice as this system, while explained, does require a bit of guidance.

Each level consists of a piece of cheese and a hole to serve as a start and end point. Players have two minutes to get to the cheese and get back to the hole, jockeying for position with other mice along the way. In addition to pits, ledges, and other difficult-to-reach places, some levels include elements with physics-based properties, such as bridges that wobble and snap if too many mice are on it.

One mouse on each level is the shaman, who has mystical powers that allow him to place elements in the world to (theoretically) help all mice reach the cheese. He can bridge gaps or build ramps to help, and the more mice who reach the cheese on his watch, the faster he progresses up the shaman skill tree to learn even more impressive talents. But a poor shaman can also just get in the way, “accidentally” blocking off areas and leading mice to their doom.

With seven game modes, hundreds of official maps, and millions of player-created maps, no two rounds of Transformice are ever exactly the same.

Heroes & Generals is Reto-Moto’s World War II-based massively multiplayer online FPS that mixes infantry, armor, and aircraft in intense man-to-man skirmishes and long-ranging battles for territory across the European theater. Battle as a soldier from one of three nations and utilize a wide range of tactics to seize territory and drive your enemies from the battlefield.

Three nations are represented in Heroes & Generals: the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Characters begin as simple infantrymen and as they gain experience, they advance along an experience tree that lets them specialize in other branches of the military, such as tank driver, pilot, recon (sniper), or paratrooper. Each specialization has its own equipment it can use, from an array of hand-to-hand weapons to tanks and planes for the tankers and pilots, and all equipment can be extensively modified.

The battles themselves take place across large areas meant to resemble various WWII-era cities and military installations. Combat is low-key and fairly realistic, and with the large, wide-open maps, tactics and strategy often count for more than just having a quick trigger finger. Most battles pit two of the nations against each other, but a few are full-scale, three-way brawls. In any case, the object of each battle is to capture all opposing spawn points or kill enemies until they have no spawns left.

At higher levels, players can take part in the “generals game,” purchasing and maneuvering mixed forces across a map of Europe to capture cities for their chosen nation. Battles between opposing forces can be auto-resolved if highly unbalanced or fought out by actual players in the cases of close battles. The results of these battles change the tactical map, and at the end of every session, the nation that wins the overall war is granted bonus rewards.

Use hundreds of parts to create your unique robot and then take it into battle against other players in a “robo-MOBA,” where the action is fierce and the parts will be flying like popcorn!

Robots in Robocraft are made of cubes, which you gain access to by leveling up your robot. The more cubes your robot has, the higher its robot ranking, and the higher its robot ranking, the more rewards you get in battle that you can use to buy even more cubes. There are over 200 cubes and other components you can acquire to beef up your robot, and the options for building them are nearly limitless. Your robots can drive, walk, or fly, and bristle with weapons, from SMGs to railguns to plasma launchers.

Once your robot is kitted out and ready for a fight, take it into one of Robocraft’s multiplayer modes, such as the battle arena, where each team is tasked with taking out its opponent’s protonium reactor while protecting their own. Towers on the map can be captured and used to strike at your opponents, giving this game mode a very MOBA-like feel. For something a little simpler, try your basic team deathmatch, where the object is to wipe out all of your opponents or capture their base, or the Pit, a free-for-all battle with respawns, where the object is to reach a set number of kills. You can also practice your skills against a test robot or in single-player mode.

More cubes, weapons, and game modes are always in development, and its flexible building system means there’s virtually no limit as to what you can do in Robocraft. Take your robot-building skills to the limit and see how long you can survive!",

You’ll fight for your life against zombies and other players, trying to survive against impossible odds in a post-apocalyptic landscape.

When you start a new character in Unturned, you’ll be dropped off in a random location on the map, with little in the way of supplies to keep you alive. You’ll have to hunt and scavenge for clothes, weapons, food, and drink. Supplies can be further refined into new materials using the game’s extensive crafting system and can even build permanent bases to fortify themselves against both zombie and human enemies. There are also vehicles to be found, which can be used to get around or to act as an additional weapon to flatten your foes. As they harvest items and kill NPCs, characters gain skill points they can use to increase their offensive, defensive, and miscellaneous/support capabilities.

Unturned has four difficulty levels, set by the server owner. Easy mode is for players new to survival games and has greater loot drops. Normal mode is the standard. Hardcore mode makes several game elements more difficult and removes most UI elements for a more “natural” experience. Finally, there’s Gold mode, available only to Gold subscribers, with vastly increased loot spawns and XP gains. Also If you’re after a battle royale game then seek out Unturned: Arena Mode

Unturned was developed by 16-year-old Nelson Sexton, who cut his designing teeth by creating popular levels for Roblox. Despite its humble origins and simple artistic design, Unturned has been downloaded on Steam by nearly 20 million players as of the start of 2016 and Sexton continues to update the game on a regular basis, with his only compensation being inexpensive Gold packs that allow for premium servers and greater character customization.",

There are four classes in Warface – rifleman, sniper, medic, and engineer – and all have to work together to complete the objective at hand. There are loads of options for modifying your chosen class’s primary and secondary weapons, so no two characters ever play quite the same. In combat, you’ll utilize several traditional and high-intensity moves, such as vaulting over obstacles or sliding to take out the bad guys, and any class might be called upon to help out an ally in need.

Battles in Warface take place all over the world, from the Balkans of Eastern Europe to the crowded city streets of Asia to the oil fields of the Middle East. There is a wide variety of mission types available, in both PvP and co-operative PvE. In PvP missions, players choose one of the two sides in the global war: the U.S. military splinter group Warface or the opportunistic mercenaries of Blackwood. Warface also recently introduced a new Battle Royale mode with a brand new PvP map created especially for the Battle Royale mode.

The PvE mission types run the gamut of gameplay. One type of mission, Cyber Horde, was added during Halloween 2013 and tasks players with escorting a truck through territory that’s infested with cyborg zombies. Other PvE mission types see players searching for a mech in a hostile village or playing through a series of three missions.",

Characters have both heavy and light attacks at their disposal, as well as plenty of aerial acrobatics they can perform. Matches end after a time limit, or when a sufficient number of kills have been reached.

Each match in Brawlhalla can be fully customized for length, arena, and number of players. Play online with friends or with random opponents. You can compete in casual matches or take your skills to ranked 1v1 arenas by yourself or in 2v2 with a friend to climb up the ranking ladder. Matches can support up to eight players, in 4v4 team battles, or you can practice alone or against bots to master your moves.

Players take on the roles of mythological gods and other legendary cultural icons, such as Zeus, Isis, Kali, or Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Gods fill the typical roles of mage, warrior, hunter, guardian, or assassin, and they can augment their abilities with items purchased during matches. Each god has a basic attack and four unique abilities, in line with their traditional powers, such as Zeus’ mastery of lightning or Sun Wukong’s transformations.

Unlike other MOBAs and their overhead view, SMITE has an over-the-shoulder, third-person look, which sets it apart visually and offers more strategic options for long-range targeting. There are multiple game modes to SMITE, but the most popular is the traditional MOBA-style five-on-five Conquest mode. In this mode, there are three lanes, protected by towers and phoenixes, with the ultimate goal of taking down the opposing team’s titan in their home base. The other areas of the map contain camps of enemies that players can defeat to earn experience and gold to level up their gods and to buy more and better items. And, of course, killing your opponents doesn’t hurt, either.

Other game modes in SMITE include Arena, a kind of team deathmatch; Joust, a limited form of Conquest with just one lane; Assault, similar to ARAM modes in other MOBAs; and Siege, a game mode with a special juggernaut that powers through enemy defenses.

There are an infinite number of ways to build your deck and games require strategic thinking and the ability to adapt rapidly to an ever-changing field of play.

You’ll start by creating a deck based around a hero who represents one of the classes of World of Warcraft, such as hunter, mage, warlock, or druid. Decks contain 30 cards, with no more than two of any individual cards or one legendary card. Legendaries represent some of the most powerful and notable characters in the World of Warcraft universe, such as Ragnaros or Deathwing, and can swing the balance of a game the instant they hit the board.

Games are turn-based. On your turn, you play minions and cast spells, and then use your minions to attack your opponent’s minions or his hero directly. Each player starts with 30 health, and the object is to reduce your opponent’s health to zero before he can do the same to you.

There are several game modes in Hearthstone. You can play casual games or compete in ranked play to work your way up the ranking ladder and achieve the Legend status. There’s also the Arena, where players pay a fee to enter and build their decks from a random assortment of cards. They are then matched up against other Arena players until they take three losses or win 12 games. The farther a player progresses in the Arena, the greater his rewards.

A thousand years in the future, the Great Houses of humanity war on each other and on a common enemy, and their weapon of choice is 80-ton walking arsenals known as ‘mechs. Equip your ‘mech with the latest weapons and gear and take to the battlefield to turn your opponents into scrap metal!

After selecting your faction, your most important task as an aspiring ‘mech pilot is to choose the chassis of your ‘mech. From light scouts to heavy assault ‘mechs, each ‘mech has its own specialty and role on the battlefield. Some are better at close-quarters fighting, while other excel at long range or quick-hitting attacks, unable to sustain long-term encounters. Once you’ve chosen a ‘mech chassis, it’s time to kit it out. The weight of equipment and its power consumption are factors you must balance to ensure that your ‘mech can continue to move and fight in long battles.

There are several match types: Conquest (victory points), Assault (capture the base), Skirmish (deathmatch), and Invasion (attack/defend), which can be contested on one of over a dozen maps. In addition to one-off matches, MechWarrior Online has Faction Play, which pits the various factions against each other for control of the Inner Sphere.

As you complete matches, you’ll earn C-bills, which you can use to buy more equipment for your ‘mech, or entirely new ‘mechs. Some equipment can only be purchased with ‘mech credits, which are awarded in smaller amounts in certain matches or bought with real money. Finally, the ‘mechs themselves earn ‘mech XP, which can be used to unlock additional capabilities and skills for the ‘mechs. There are many ways to play MechWarrior Online, so the key is finding the strategies and equipment that work the best for you.",

Squadrons of planes become available through game progression and range from entry-level Tier-I planes all the way to Tier X jet powered aircraft. Each plane within the same tier has varying stats for maneuverability and firepower based on the nation to which the plane belongs.

The game features two different modes of PvP. In Training Mode, the focus is on learning the basics of aircraft maneuverability and firing weapons at an assortment of static and moving targets. This is accomplished through a series of lessons. In Standard Battles players can advance by destroying all of the enemies’ aircraft or by gaining more supremacy points than the opponent. Supremacy points are gained by destroying ground objects and aircraft.

World of Warplanes features three types of in-game currency: credits, experience, and gold. Wargaming.net features a “Unified Account System” allowing players to share certain in game currencies between their World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, and World of Warships accounts including Premium Time, Free Experience, and Gold.

Trion Worlds’ flagship MMORPG, Rift, started as a subscription based MMORPG and later made a free-to-play conversion in June of 2013. MMORPG players probably remember Rift’s aggressive advertising campaign leading up to its 2011 release. This campaign specifically touted Telara, the game’s world, as the new place for players to be and poked fun at chief rival World of Warcraft with slogans like “You’re not in Azeroth anymore” in most print and media advertisements.

Character creation in Rift allows players to choose their race (limited by faction) and a starting archetype (calling) for your playstyle. The five callings currently available are Primalist, Warrior, Mage, Cleric, and Rogue. Players have ample room for customizations inside these callings though as each calling has a multitude of “souls” (what would be more traditionally referred to as “classes”) that allow players to mix and match abilities within each calling to customize their character’s abilities. This mixing and matching of multiple souls allows hundreds of playstyle combinations, some more viable than others. Some souls are only available through purchases of cash shop packages.

Rift features two faction gameplay between The Defiant and The Guardians, although updates since launch have blurred the lines between factions by allowing factions to group together, chat, and even guild together. Factions still play a role in Rift’s PvP Warfronts. This PvP content features multiple maps and gameplay types that focus on point accumulation or point capturing. Open world PvP is also supported provided you are playing on a PvP server.

Players looking for PvE content will find that Rift offers a vast world to explore, dungeons (solo, duo and party varieties), raids, in world events such as the “Rifts” for which the game is named, and an extensive storyline detailing the elemental planes and how they interconnect and impact the world of Telara. “Instant Adventures” allow players to group quickly, and level rather quickly, through quick bursts of open world content. Traditional questing is also a leveling option.

Numerous subsystems provide Rift players with ample activities in which to partake. Player housing is accomplished through a “Dimensions” system that allows players to unlock multiple area types and decorate them as they see fit. This system has been expanded to also allow players to create their own PvP Dimensions and bring their own PvP maps to life. The Minion mini-game, crafting, collectibles, and achievement hunting are big parts of the Rift community and numerous sites cater to each of these items alone.

While equipment is available in Rift’s cash shop, this equipment is “one off or worse” than the current best equipment available in the game. To achieve the best gear, players will have to play the game and cannot buy their way to max power. Most of this gear is also available through in game currency gathering as well. The cash shop is designed in a “time versus money” approach with players being able to spend either the in game time or the cash to advance quickly, but either method ends with players having to play to achieve the best in slot items. Patron (subscription) status is available for those that want to earn Loyalty points (a cash shop “rewards” program) and receive monthly perks allowing for more rapid character advancement. Players wishing to buy cash shop items without spending real world money have the option of purchasing “REX” in game from other players. REX can be used to obtain credits that can be spent in the cash shop.

Rift is available directly from the Trion Worlds site or through Steam.",

There are several character classes in Path of Exile, revolving around three primary attributes – strength, dexterity, and intelligence – or using a mix of two or all three, such as the duelist, a melee class that relies on strength and dexterity. Characters advance through Path of Exiles enormous skill tree, which allows players to select new passive and active abilities as they level up. Gear is similarly flexible, with high-end equipment having slots that can equip gems that provide various bonus effects. In total, there are countless ways to build and equip characters, so that no two will ever be the same.

Path of Exile has a traditional MMO experience, where players can progress through various zones, level up, and gain gear, but there are several other ways to play as well. The most popular is races, where players start with brand new characters and compete to acquire the most experience or achieve other goals over a set period of time, which can range anywhere from a few minutes to a month. Each race season features a number of events, usually numbering over a hundred, and sometimes include race modifiers to make things more challenging.

Finally, Path of Exile has a true commitment to free-to-play, with a relatively small cash shop and no items that grant advantage. It’s become a favorite of many hardcore gamers for its diverse option and challenging content, but it can be enjoyed by a wide range of players of all skill levels.",

Launched in 2013 to provide an alternative to Riot Games’ League of Legends, Dota 2 cranks up the strategy dial, requiring mastery of one’s hero and exemplary communication between all team members in a game that consistently ranks as one of the best MOBAs in the world.

Two opposing teams of five players select from over a hundred heroes, each with their own unique abilities, to fill out their teams. They travel down three lanes, each guarded by a series of defensive towers and patrolled by AI enemies that are friendly to one of the teams and spawn continuously. The space between lanes, the “jungle,” is occupied by neutral enemies that either team can kill to obtain bonuses. The object of the game is to push through the opponents’ defenses all the way to their base, where their Ancient resides, and destroy it.

Heroes come in a wide variety of flavors, with many different talents and roles. They increase in power as their team kills AI enemies and other players, accumulating XP to level up and gold that can be used to purchase items at their base. Making the proper purchases for your role is an essential piece of strategy, to the point that having the correct “build” is a major part of your strategy.

Thanks in part to its visibility on Valve’s Steam platform, Dota 2 also has a very active professional competitive e-sports scene, with local, regional, national, and worldwide tournaments that offer millions of dollars in prizes. A documentary, titled Free to Play, was released in 2014, and it’s an example of how serious Valve is about bringing e-sports into the mainstream, using its games to tell a story and presenting them as a viable viewing option on par with major professional sports.",

Players choose from different 8 classes, these being Tank, Inquisitor, Paladin, Berserker, Sorceress, Witch, Gunner, and Sapper. The classes are best suited to different styles of gameplay, for example the Paladin performs best as a support, where as the Berserker is ideal for full on melee combat.

The game includes a total of 4 very different game types with dynamic Team-Based PvP and PvE, including maps for each game type. Game types include Domination, King of the Hill, Siege, and Meteor. In a game of Domination players must attack opposing forces for a point of interest, in King of the Hill, players must hold a landmark, and defend making sure that the enemy does not gain control, Siege, is where players need to attack multiple objectives, and the enemy team needs to defend, and lastly the Meteor game type, where the player needs to look for an objective element, and return it to the players base.

Unlike games such as League of Legends which uses an isometric perspective, the player is controlled using a third person view. The landscape is remarkable incredible from snowy and cold environments, to volcanoes. Which are all rendered with the lovely CryEngine 3 game engine. The maps are handled nicely since when you start a new game the map will be chosen randomly.  A unique aspect for each map are the secrets in the map which a player can use to change the map for the players advantage.

Attacking enemy players in Panzar is based on a free-targeting type of game. Damaging enemy players is entirely based on the angle of attack. The controls for the game use the mouse in order to strike attacks. The left mouse button is used for auto-attacks, and the right mouse button is used for massive power attacks which drains your power. Power in the game is indicated by a power bar, which can be restored using abilities to the player, or by just simply waiting for the power bar to fill. Magic in the game including abilities use mana, and a points called action points. Action points in the game are earned through killing enemy players.

New players will take the role of an aspiring martial arts expert and will choose one of 8 schools. The school you choose will alter what skills your character will learn (and become more proficient at) over time and learning these skill “books” is the game’s primary advancement technique as Age of Wushu eschews the traditional “leveling” mechanics found in other MMOs. Your chosen school also determines the weapon type your character will use.

Age of Wushu has been developed using a proprietary engine called “FLEXI.” This engine allows the game to maintain a higher graphical performance and makes updates to technology easier to implement in game by simply adding new modules to the engine rather than upgrading the entire engine itself.

Combat in Age of Wushu is a bit different than other MMORPGs. Combat takes on a more “rock-paper-scissors” mentality. Skills are categorized as “Overt” damage skills, “Feint” defense-breaking skills, and “Block” defensive skills. There are secondary “Chi” (energy) draining skills outside of these three categories but combat primarily revolves around using the right skill type at the right type to react to PvE and PvP threats. Movement skills, including gliding, jumping, and water walking, make the game’s combat reminiscent of martial arts movie action scenes.

While Age of Wushu features traditional MMORPG features like questing, PvP, an in game marketplace, and a story that’s been expanded through multiple game expansions, the game is maybe most well-known for some of its more unique features. The “Offline Mode” allows players to advance their characters in some ways while not actually playing the game. Assigning your character duties in shops, school, or other locations while you are offline can net your character benefits when you return to the game. The other side of that feature, though, allows players in game to kidnap offline players for gains of their own. In game, players can also use systems like the “Criminal System” to place bounties on other players.

Age of Wushu brings some unique items to the MMO game space but may not be a hit with all players. It is certainly a game that benefits from playing for free for a bit prior to spending money on something that may not be your “cup of tea.”",

Choose from multiple space craft units and man your battle stations as you fly around in nicely detailed space environments and try to take down your opponents using a variety of special abilities and weaponry.

Following a similar progression tree as War Thunder, Star Conflict focuses on tactical based third person shooting and PvP. After each match, players are awarded credits and experience and can use both to upgrade and research every aspect of their fleet from weapons to actual space craft. After researching and upgrading, players can swap out parts on their spacecraft adding more armor to lighter attack ships, more firepower to smaller ships, or generally customize their favorite ship to be a freak of space nature on the battlefield.

While Star Conflict is primarily a team based PvP game, players do have the option of taking on quests (also available in PvP play as secondary objectives) and some PvE content geared towards both group and solo play. Since players will be joining one of three factions at the start of their space career, each faction has different objectives based on their faction’s needs. Certain spacecraft are even faction specific.

With detailed environments, a deep progression system, a multitude of spacecraft to choose from, and a cash shop similar to War Thunder’s, Star Conflict provides players with a top notch space combat simulator and encourages players to form up into alliances and create corporations that can control sections of the galaxy through combat domination.

Star Conflict is available for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms.",

The Banner Saga focuses on the fight against the Dredge, a dread warlike race bent on destroying humanity. Players in the series must find the weakness of the Dredge before it is far too late.

By 2013, the game had undergone a free-to-play conversion that brought a great number of new players into TERA. Developed by Bluehole Studios, TERA is most well-known for its combat. Rather than use traditional MMORPG tab targeting, TERA opts for an action combat system based on movement, positioning, aiming, and successful execution of skill combinations. Recent class additions, like the Brawler, have even pushed the action combat into the realm of fighting game like controls since the Brawler is able to actually juggle enemies and dish out the damage.

When you create a new character in TERA you will not be choosing a faction but you will have to choose from one of the seven currently available races. Careful though. Your choice of race can limit what classes are available to you. Decide what class you want to be first, then pick one of the races that allow you to be that class. There are currently 11 classes available in TERA: Archer, Berserker, Lancer, Mystic, Priest, Reaper, Slayer, Sorcerer, Warrior, Gunner, and Brawler. Again, some classes are race and gender locked to specific race/gender combinations.

Once in game, players will take on a multitude of quests, dungeons, missions, daily quests, PvP matches (when you reach the appropriate level), and other content on their way to level cap through a traditional experience/leveling system. The fantasy world of TERA is beautifully rendered and is visually fantastic to explore.

For those of a more social persuasion, TERA features a voting system allowing guilds to become leaders based on how players on the server vote. The leaders of the elected guilds are named Vanguards and have some new functionality open to them.

While recent expansions and updates have added the usual new content (quests, dungeons, classes, etc) some updates have added totally new features to the game. Recent additions such as Guild Housing and the “Returning Player” assistance menu have made TERA a place for players to come back to even if they’ve been away from the game for a while.",

Each soldier belongs to one of three factions: the militaristic and rigid Terran Republic, the rebellious and independent New Conglomerate, or the tech-savvy and futuristic Vanu Sovereignity. There are six classes in the game, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and players can freely swap their characters between those classes to suit their current task. The game also boasts several vehicles, ranging from tanks and armored personnel carriers to futuristic fighter jets and flying troop transports, so you never know just what you’ll be up against. You can fill a role as a driver or pilot, support your allies with healing or ammunition, or just get behind a big gun and blow people away.

Battle across the continents of Auraxis is a base-hopping affair, with each of the three factions striving to control the most territory by attacking enemy bases and defending their own. There are a number of different facilities, requiring coordination from infantry, armor, and air forces to conquer. Sometimes, efficient strategy and tactics win the day, and other times, a simple full-on direct assault will do the trick.

As you play, you’ll earn certifications you can use to buy new weapons and passive abilities for your characters and your vehicles, or you can buy them with real money.

RPG MO is a nostalgic sandbox experience reminiscent of old-school RPG’s like Ultima and Runescape. In combat, players can switch between various stances to level different skills.

Additionally, players can take on the role of a merchant collecting materials through mining and chopping wood to level crafting abilities and create valuable items to sell to other players. The game boasts a wide range of over a dozen skills players can train in with no level caps. Players can choose to specialize, focusing on specific skills, or level them all up. Players can also build their own homes, which are visible to other players.

The game offers various PvE quests, and allows players to collaborate with each other for group dungeon quests. Players can also fight each other in PvP zones. Boasting a large, loyal player base and consistent updates, RPG MO serves as a fun, addicting does of pixilated nostalgia.",

Fight alongside iconic characters such as Aragorn and Gandalf, and aid Frodo in his quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom!

Your LOTRO character can be one of four races – elf, hobbit, dwarf, or man – and 10 classes. Character roles follow traditional MMORPG conventions, with tanks, healers, DPS, and crowd control classes, and the world is filled with thousands of quests and dozens of instanced encounters that you can take on alone or in groups of varying sizes. You’ll need to master a wide array of character skills and abilities and, later in the game, even acquire the ability to engage in mounted combat from atop your own war-steed. Another unique gameplay element is fellowship maneuvers, which occasionally require party members to execute a sequence of attacks to achieve spectacular results.

The world of Middle-earth is lushly represented in The Lord of the Rings Online, from the rolling pastures of the Shire to the elven architecture of Rivendell to the realm of the Witch-king in Angmar to the expansive plains of Rohan. The Mines of Moria represent another vast area in the game, where players will be tasked with aiding a dwarf colony retake their ancestral home.

Developed by the Aion Team and published by a number of publishers worldwide (most notably NCSoft in the US and GameForge in the EU),

New players will choose a faction and then choose one of 6 classes (Warrior, Scout, Mage, Priest, Technist, and Muse) to start the game and will have the chance to further specialize this class upon “Ascending” when you reach level 10. This is also when players will receive the feature Aion may most well be known for, your wings. Using these wings, players can glide and swoop their way down onto foes in both PvE and PvP content.

Since its initial Western launch, Aion has undergone many changes to shed the stigma of the “grindy” game it was viewed as at launch. New content has been added to streamline leveling, a new “Fast Track” server where players can play at a faster experience rate was introduced, and early game content has been streamlined to push players into the newer updates and expansions faster.

PvE players will find a plethora of dungeons (solo, duo, and party varieties) to tackle and can look forward to late game raiding (note that “raids” in Aion are small party affairs) as well.

PvP and PvPvE was, perhaps, the most notable feature in the game when it launched as the flight aspect of PvP introduced a new take on player combat. PvPvE also pits both factions against each other in the Abyss while introducing monsters and NPC characters that both factions have to contend with at the same time. The Abyss also features points like castles that can be taken over by players as this zone is highly dynamic when on an active server.

Aion is available on Steam or through a direct download and still enjoys regular updates.",

Stronghold Kingdoms adds in a card mechanic that allows players to use cards as modifiers when building, trading, and attacking or defending their own Stronghold. As in previous titles though, diplomacy is a key aspect of success in Strongholds Kingdoms. Trading, negotiating, and working with thousands of other players through the game’s world is the key to taking over land and working your way up to a leadership role. Be careful though as working against the wrong alliance could spell the end to all of your hard work very quickly.

Stronghold Kingdoms gathered early praise when it launched in 2012, but recent player reviews lean more towards the game becoming more pay to win than most players would like. With well-established alliances in game already, starting out can be hard for new players looking to try out the game for a bit prior to spending real life money.

Star Wars: The Old Republic allows players to become one of several different iconic classes including Jedi, Sith, and Troopers, with a variety of species to choose from. Each class follows their own unique custom storyline which contains a number of dynamic questions allowing players to become immersed in their character’s progression and ultimately choose their own destiny.

Players choose to join either the Galactic Republic or the Sith Empire. The game is set more than 3,500 years prior to the films and allows players to visit and interact with some classic environments such as the planets Tatooine and Coruscant. While each class may favor a certain playstyle (tank, DPS, or healer) customization options along with companion characters allow the individual player to adapt to a number of situations without relying on the support of other players. Character appearance customization is limited to a few slide bar choices but further options are available through the cash shop with the use of Cartel Coins.

Character leveling and progression is done through the standard missions, exploration, and defeating enemies. New skills are learned at each level and are taught by trainers in a number of locations. There are heroic missions that require the cooperation of other players and can typically be repeated on a daily basis. Leveling has been vastly accelerated to encourage players to jump into the game’s more recent expansions.

One of the more unique features about Star Wars: The Old Republic is that the dynamic choices players make can permanently open or close parts of the story line and can affect the player’s NPC companions and any relationships you may have with those companions.

Crafting in Star Wars: The Old Republic is a much more passive activity than the typical MMORPG, NPC companions carry out the gathering and crafting activates as assigned by the player while the player is participating in active adventures. A player can assign up to 5 companions to perform 3 different skills.

Star Wars: The Old Republic has taken some heat for a somewhat restrictive cash shop. In fact, some of the features mentioned above may be hidden behind a “cash wall” The game does still offer a subscription for players who prefer that experience.",

While DCUO sports many traditional MMORPG systems, the game also has a more unique interface specifically designed for an MMO that spans both PC and console platforms, and one that lends itself very well to controller play.

PvE content is explored primarily through the use of story episodes, raids, Duo instances, and Iconic Battles. Following the game’s DLC story additions, DCUO allows players to fly, sprint, and brawl their way through memorable locations such as Gotham City, Metropolis, and others all while assisting well known DC Universe characters throughout the DLC story. DCUO is a free-to-play title, but additional DLC does come at a cost for those that do not opt for the monthly subscription fee. These additional content items (episodes) can be purchased individually as can additional character slots and other in-game items.

On the PvP side of content, DCUO provides two primary PvP options: Arenas and Legends. Matches come in the 1v1, 2v2, 4v4, 5v5, and 8v8 variety. Legends PvP allows players to assume the role of pre-balanced iconic DC characters regardless of the player’s actual character level or faction affiliation. This mode is a nice way for players to farm PvP currency without having to wait until they level but some heroes and villains are locked and require either a cash purchase or unlocking with PvP currency. Arenas are the more standard PvP option allowing players to take their individual characters into the fray. Open world PvP is available provided that the player has entered a PvP server.

Fight your way with friends through multiple mission types and objectives while trying to avoid becoming infected by zombies yourself.

Speaking up could earn you a quick death at the hands of your own teammates.

Players are able to modify their server rules and can make the game more realistic by not using typical gameplay features like a HUD or even crosshairs. Even voice chat and text chat is limited by distance so keep your friends close. While some servers opt for unlimited ammo, the traditional gameplay keeps things dire by providing very little ammo and a sense of dread as zombies of different varieties close on your location. Some are fast, some may be slow, and in the end, it may not be a zombie that is the most dangerous to you.

In Dragon Nest, players select from a number of pre-created heroes that have various skill sets (specializing in magic, ranged, melee, etc) and play through a series of instance based “dungeons” to level, learn new skills, and gain fame and fortune. What the game lacks in character creation options (you really only customize color and clothing) the game makes up for in its more action and arcade style combat. Players will be challenged in combat (you can adjust difficulty) and will require lightning fast reactions and intelligent use of skill combinations to take down their foes…even other players. This makes combat (and PvP) more of a skill based encounter where skill can trump character level.

Dragon Nest is well known for its epic boss battles. Expect to see big monsters and creatures that will challenge the way players approach each fight. Aim true, if you don’t you’ll spend a lot of time missing.

Stunning visuals and smooth animations will keep players visually enthralled while they rack up kill after kill in the game’s constantly changing dungeons. Many players though have bemoaned a recent update that altered the game’s existing content in favor of pushing players into new dungeons tailored to higher levels. The game’s cash shop also garners some criticism with the offering of special in game items in addition to the standard costume/pet fare. Dragon Nest also has inspired some manga, films, and collectible figures.",

You start out as a nobody that has to quest and level up within your selected clan all the way to level 25 before you are even able to select a class to play as. There are four classes: warrior, healer, nuker, and hybrid. Once a player reaches level 102 they are able to ‘upgrade’ their class giving them access to all new Kung Fu skills that make the end game just as exciting as the beginning.

While there are PvE quests and events that you can participate the main goal is for you to develop your Kung Fu skills to battle other players from different clans in PvP battles. While there are many different clans to choose from there are only two major factions, the White Clans, which are loyal to the Imperial Emperor, and the Black Clans, which are loyal to no one except themselves.

There is also a very unique player created clan system in this game called bands. A band can have 40 members and once you reach 40 members you can join a league which is comprised of 5 different bands that can all be from different White or Black clans.

Players create a new character by choosing from 1 of 2 factions (The League or The Empire) and from 1 of 8 typical class archetypes. Players level their characters through questing, dungeons, and PvP and choose upgrades in a typical skill tree along the way. Combat is “hotbar” based and uses tab targeting, but Allods Online does offer a more unique ship based combat while searching the game’s large world area called “The Astral.”

Players can build and customize their own ships and use them to access zones that are restricted from accessing any other way. Player versus Player ship combat is also possible. On foot, open world PvP is available provided you are flagged for PvP and you’ve reached at least level 21 and larger scale PvP becomes available at level 60.

PvE players can expect questing (side and story quests), dungeon runs, raids and other typical MMORPG content. Along the way to max level, players will learn skills, take place in the game’s market, learn to use mounts for faster transportation, and unlock other character gains. Players can also take on pets and customize them.

On the payment side of things, Allods Online has gone through its own trials over the years. A few missteps with high cash shop prices, a brutally penalizing death mechanic, and a few items of questionable offering all led to a rather large player base backlash. These items have since been changed or removed entirely but the “stigma” still remains in some ways.

Since the end of the Dragon War, dragons and humans have lived in peace, albeit on separate worlds ­ humans in their homeland, and dragons exiled to the depths of Aether. But the peace was not to last, for the Dark Dragon Elga would lead a revolt that would bring the death of the Dragon Lord and an invasion of dragons to the human world. That was one thousand years ago; the Five Heroes defeated Elga in battle and imprisoned him in the labyrinth of the Shadow Cabinet. But the victory brought about by the Five Heroes doesn’t last. One of them, Paris, promised Elga freedom in exchange for immortality and beauty, she then launched an attack against her old allies ­ and looked to Elga to form an alliance.

                            Description = @"Vindictus is a free to play action MMO game (MORPG) by Nexon, the same people who brought you Mabinogi. This prequel to Mabinogi takes place several hundred years before the story of Mabinogi. In Korea, the game is known as Mabinogi Heroes, though the name was changed for North American and European audiences.

In the beginning of Vindictus, humans are convinced that if they can destroy Fomors, or monstrous humanoids, they will essentially be taken into their version of Heaven, known as Erinn. Players battle through hordes of enemies either alone, with friends, or sometimes with strangers, to take out these creatures. Vindictus is broken up into “Seasons” and with each season, the story changes and brings a whole new level of exploration and understanding.

The game centers around an intense combat style that teaches you to avoid getting hit or die. Fighting Combos are also valued far more than a general face-roll concept many MMOs have found themselves taking on. The ten classes of the game are all gender-locked, as you are portraying a particular character rather than just a class, but some customization of the characters is allowed, including coloring or cutting their hair. The dungeons have dynamic difficulty with the health of the bosses scaling to the number of people in the party.

Vindictus holds true to Nexon’s business model and is free to download and play, while offering a “Cash Shop” for those willing to drop some money on the game. Filled with magicians, warriors, archers and thieves of all varieties, your choices will depend on your personal fighting preferences and your desired role within the game. All classes are intended to deal damage and be self-sufficient as they battle through a real-time combat system. The world has several cities that act as hubs for people to form parties with instanced mission stages where quest objectives are completed. For those seeking beautiful graphics and an intense battle-style, Vindictus may be just the ticket.",

Oh well… if you showed up here I should at least give you the basics. League of Legends is a free-to-play competitive MOBA game, and one of the most played video game in the world, developed by Riot Games.

Players are tasked with teaming up with other players and squaring off against another team of players, typically in 5v5 matches. Three lanes connect a team’s base (or Nexus) to the other team’s base. Defensive measures for both teams also reside in each lane. Players choose a hero from over 120 Champions. Each character has its own skill set and abilities that help it excel in certain areas of the game. The key to winning matches is teamwork and solid reactions to enemy abilities. A strong understanding of the item meta game and what helps each particular champion is certainly desirable.

Push each lane and try to take out your opponent’s defensive turrets (and their ever spawning creeps – small NPC minions that blindly move forward on each lane) and enemy champions on your way to taking out the enemy Nexus and scoring yourself a win.

Along the way, your champion will gain experience and gold and level up their abilities and allow you to purchase game items to modify your champion’s stats and performance.

These battles take place in two different game modes across a total of 4 available maps…although you’re probably only going to ever see one map unless you play in games against AI bot opponents.

In addition to in-game leveling and ranked matches each season, players also have modifiers on their profile through the use of Rune Pages. These pages allow players to “socket” Glyphs, Marks, Seals, and Quintessences to modify stats for you as the player. These modifications are then placed on any Champion you choose to play.

Matchmaking in League of Legends is based primarily on your skill and past match performances. The automated system attempts to match competitors up with players of a similar skill level so as to avoid blowout matches.

League of Legends is often held up as the quintessential free-to-play model in that no aspect of gameplay (besides arguably additional rune pages even though they are not essential) is locked behind a cash shop purchase. The cash shop houses skins, cosmetics, and Champions and currency to purchase these items can be bought with real world money or farmed in-game.",

Combining the skill sets creates 60 different possibilities and can adapt the game to fit each player’s own play style.

Each class must be leveled separately and the secondary class is always capped at the level of the main class.

Players can participate in one-on-one dance battles or team up with others. While dancing, players must strike certain keys to progress through the dancing sequence to unlock more advanced moves and combos. The dance halls in 5Street feature selections of music based on top music charts from around the world and feedback from players. The game was developed by Snail Games has a large fan base in China and a growing presence in the U.S. and Europe.

The customization aspect is a major draw of the game, as players can don thousands of different outfits available in the in-game stores. However, certain outfits cost real money—rather than in-game currency. Players can also attain various, unique in-game pets. Additionally, every 5Street player own a virtual home for storing extra items. Unfortunately, these homes offer little in the way of customization.

The game is visually appealing, boasting decent graphics and realistic dance moves. However, the social aspect of the game is what sets it apart from otherwise similar dancing MMOs. Players’ interactive options do not stop at dancing. For example, they can communicate with each other via emotes ranging from punching to kissing. 5Street also features a romantic element that allows players to participate in couples dancing and even marriage. Additionally, players can video-chat with each other in the designated video-chat dance halls.

5Street keeps players coming back by offering quests and achievements, and publicly-displayed leaderboards featuring the highest-ranking players. While the amount of songs available is nothing special compared to other online rhythm games like Audition Online, the ample opportunity for avatar customization and social element makes 5Street a unique, entertaining dancing MMO.",

Join or create a guild and take control of a town to get more money and gear for making your main character stronger.

After making those two choices you get to choose from six different classes: Assassin, Archer, Summoner, Priest, Warrior, or Wizard all with various different skill sets and abilities.

The PvE in this game is made up of tons of quests that offer different challenges and take you all throughout the world of 4Story. Go solo and do the quests or join up with a guild and take on some of the most dangerous areas in the game to earn the best rewards.

If PvE isn’t your style you can always look for the games PvP aspects. If you are looking for a small scale PvP experience, you can go the dueling arena where you can fight with small groups in 3v3 battles that will award you bigger and bigger prizes as you claim the ranks. If you are looking for a larger scale PvP combat than that you can join your faction in trying to conquer the other faction’s territories in larger 50v50 player combat.

4Story is an enjoyable MMORPG where you can customize your character, join guilds and battle other factions. It has plenty of content that you can spend hours with and not run out and even if you hit the end game you can continue to play and improve.",

The Dumianas decided to kill Etain due to questioning her power. Due to this, Etain’s soul was torn in half, leaving Teos vulnerable and unbalanced. This allowed other Gods to take over Teos, and other races joined the mix, adding to the conflict and war of Teos.

You can take up arms in either the Union of Fury or the Alliance of Light, with the end goal of controlling Teos for your faction, while desperately seeking the blessing of Etain. Shaiya is a MMORPG that takes a lot of its gameplay stylings from the popular title World of Warcraft. You can choose between four playable races in Shaiya, with 12 unique classes. Each race has three of the 12 classes available to them. Gaining the blessing of Etain is a huge part of Shaiya, and is determined by the Blessing of the Goddess system. There are PVP modes available in Shaiya, including large scale battles which are always a blast in any MMO.

Another key feature in Shaiya is the “Ultimate” mode. If you have ever played Diablo, you are familiar with the Permadeath system, which is what the “Ultimate” mode is based off of. If you are willing to risk your character at every corner, then this mode is for you, since the bounty from trying this mode is completely worth it.

There are the normal PvE questing and dungeons that you will find in any MMORPG out there, but if you get tired of that while you are playing Angels Online and want to relax a bit you can always collect the different mounts and pets or even play a mini-game or two for fun and reward.

While the game does not focus on the PvP side of things it does include it for people that would like to participate.

If part of your criteria is an MMO that has been out for a long period of time with solid history under its belt, then Seal Online will come onto your radar. Since it has been out since 2003, it’s one of the forerunners in the MMORPG community.

If you are looking for a MMO with simple controls, then Seal Online is also a title to consider. Almost every action you can do in Seal Online, including movement and most of the combat, is done with point-and-click functionality. The only thing that isn’t is the combo system which adds an extra layer to the combat mechanic using the ASD keys.

There are over 7 classes you can choose at the start of your adventure within Seal Online. Another cool aspect is if you choose to start with the “beginner” class, an option to switch between the other classes will be available at level 10. Seal Online offers the basic MMORPG elements as well, including guilds, in-game bank accounts to store items and currency, questing systems and the ability to create parties to play with other players.

One interesting feature in Seal Online is the use of the Combo system. During battle, the user can input combos which appear on the screen once your XP bar reaches a certain level. This allows for complicated yet interactive combat that will keep you focused and interested in combat during your long grinding sessions.

From the Russian heavy to the inebriated demoman to the military-minded soldier, each character has his own personal flair and specialized weapons. Each character’s main weapon is unique to him and helps define his role on a team. Beyond the basic armament, there are hundreds of additional weapons, created by Valve and by individual users, which have a number of different effects and are balanced by various means. And, of course, there are hats. Many, many hats.Team Fortress 2 has several different game modes, including control point, both with a single point that both teams fight over and multiple points that teams progress along in a line; capture the flag, where players attempt to return a briefcase full of enemy intelligence to their base; attack/defend, where one team tries to push a bomb into the other team’s base; as well as the PvE “Mann vs. Machine” mode, which pits players against wave after wave of robotic versions of their classes.Almost as entertaining as the game itself is Valve’s marketing for the game, which puts the characters’ personalities to the forefront in video shorts and online comic books. They range from introductory videos, such as “Meet the Medic” (and other classes) to story-based films to comics that explore the backstory and history of the Team Fortress 2 game universe.

From there, most of the other features are pretty standard, yet needed to make a proper MMORPG. There are eight different classes to choose from, Bowman, Ninja, Busker and HanBla being some of them. There is a pet mechanic built into the game, and they can be upgraded at different levels, which are 15, 50 75 and 100. With all of these easy-to-use systems along with the basic user-friendly controls, Scions of Fate is a game any new gamer looking to try a MMORPG should start with.

One other interesting mechanic worth mentioning is their Couple system. You can experience 10 “ranks of love!” which can be used to fall in “love” with other players. If the other features of Scions of Fate didn’t sell you, maybe an extra feature like that might.",

Sadly, many of the gameplay mechanics are now dated compared to today’s MMOR’PG selection, and is victim of client issues. If you can look past that, Rappelz offers many amazing features, and it’s always great to revisit MMORPGs that helped set the standard for what the genre is today.

Rappelz’s pet system was one of the first MMORPGs to offer a pet system that provide depth on this level, and even to this day many games don’t go to this extreme with their pet systems. In Rappelz you are able to catch and train virtually every creature that you encounter in the game. Your pets will assist you in fights and will even level up right along with you! In combination with this great feature, Rappelz also has the Dungeon Siege mode. In this mode your guild can take control of dungeons available in the game. By owning a dungeon, your guild obtains different bonuses including a ‘tax’ that forces other players to pay to your guild when they access this dungeon.

With Rappelz’s very unique and robust features, it set its own place in the history books. One other feature that should be mentioned is the amount of classes available. You can choose from over 30 class types, and your character can be one of the three races in the universe. Not all of the classes can be played from the start. Most of them have to be unlocked by reaching set character and job levels.",

Due to this, the three factions on Novus are in constant war with each other for control of these resources. You can join the fight as any of the three factions, with four different classes to choose from. Along with your class, the main portion of character customization stems from your specializations and gear, but the progression you decide to take in your class also alters your character.

If you are the type that hates PVP, and player killing is a constant annoyance to you, staying far away from RF online will be in your best interest, because that is what this game is based around. Besides headquarters, settlement towns and some portal locations, no area in RF online is safe from other players.

Since the entire world is at constant war with each other over resources, your job is to kill every player from opposing factions that you come in contact with. This PVP element is what makes RF Online fun because of how large-scale the battles become. Another feature within RF Online is the Chip Wars. Chip Wars causes the players to truly feel the importance of the lack of resources, forcing each faction to battle over the Guardian of the mines. These wars only happen three times a day, so gaining control over the “Chips” is important for your factions. Do you have what it takes to join the resource battle in RF Online?",

Unlike other MMOS, players are encouraged to change jobs several times in order to build the best skill set — rather than choosing one and sticking with it.

In addition to regular quests, Kalonline also features varying types of PvP, including: Castle Siege, tower defense, and more. Players can join guilds, which require six players to create.

As you progress through the game and earn more resources, you can expand your island with several different structures like rum distilleries. These distilleries are paramount in progressing through the game, rum being of obvious importance to pirates. To get resources, players can either create their own, or raid other players for their booty. Additionally, flotsam (pieces from a shipwreck) can be collected from around the shores of players’ islands, which can contain every available resource in the game. This serves as a nice means of burning time while players wait to finish researching technologies or completing new structures.

From the world map, players can see shipwrecks to salvage and other islands to pillage. Some will make for easy prey, but landlubbers beware: some will be defended by captains from neighboring islands. Troops, which are needed to attack other players, can be obtained from the tavern once it’s built. Players with the necessary resource like gold and rum can deploy their pirate fleet comprising both offensive and defensive troops. They each serve a distinct purpose, and certain missions will call for one or the other.

Once a player has attacked another player, they will appear on each other’s “enemy list.” Players can attack people on their list as much as they please, provided they have the resources. Players can also attack certain points held by other players such as stashes of gems or gold. Each point has an expiration date that ticks ever closer while it is occupied. Additionally, if a player is part of an alliance, they can deploy troops to protect points held by their friends to ensure it is not successfully plundered before the timer runs out.

The browser MMORPG features 26 distinct skills for players to level. Players do not allocate points to upgrade certain skills. Rather, their abilities are enhanced by performing certain actions like mining ore, casting spells of fishing.

The world of Gelinor is divided into various kingdoms, regions and cities. Each regions features different loot, monsters and quests to complete. You explore this vast world via a customizable avatar. The game allows you to interact with other players in various different ways including the in-game chat system, combat and mini-games that are either competitive or collaborative.

Due to the randomized elements in the Runescape’s dungeons, gameplay remains engaging rather than repetitive. You can choose to brave the world of Gelinor alone, or collaborate with other players to take down especially challenging bosses. Should you so choose, you can also engage in PvP combat. While it does not follow a linear story, the game contains myriad quests and deep, immersive narrative to keep players engaged.

Released in 2001, the game is consistently updated to add new content, new features and various special events. The third iteration of the game, known as RuneScape 3 (RS3), is an enhanced version of the RuneScape HD update. This major upgrade was launched on Monday July 22nd 2013, bringing even more features such as a new engine, customisable interfaces and new content.

As for your stock, you won’t just be ordering it. Instead, you will hand-craft  your items, using material obtained by a crack crew of adventurers that you put together. Craft, upgrade, and enchant a variety of gear ranging from swords and shields to guns. Build your very own questing party from heroes in eighteen different classes. Equip them with the weapons you make and send them on their way to battle monsters and recover much needed crafting material. 

In addition to running your own shop and procuring the materials needed to keep it afloat, you’ll also want to do some networking. Join a guild and build a city. Work together on in-game events. And don’t forget to play the market.

Rather than having to add those as they go along, players will instead need to choose which of these things they can level up. Leveling is achieved by collecting essence.

Unlike other shooters, Crucible focuses more on strategy and pre-planning than running and gunning. Instead, make good use of your abilities, and plan ahead on your upgrades to makes the best of your Hunter later in the game. Be sure to scout out the landscape as well, to be able to use it to your advantage. Only the best strategic planners will come out on top.

Players not only explore dungeons, but climb mountains, trees, and buildings to discover all kinds of secrets. 

Of course, the main character doesn’t travel alone. Instead, players build a four-player group out of over 20 characters that can be swapped out to create the best group for any particular mission. The characters, each with different skills filling out the classic RPG types as well as distinct elemental focuses, can be obtained via gameplay or the game’s gacha mechanics – as is gear. Both characters and gear are upgraded in the game via the in depth crafting system.

In addition, the game offers players an adventurer system that provides them with even more to do, be it daily quests, small favors for the locals, or big continent-traveling quests. The adventurer system also rewards players for their activities with a wide variety of items.

Genshin Impact is available to players on PC, PlayStation 4, and mobile devices. It also features a multiplayer mode allowing up to four players to play together and cross-play across all four platforms, however, PlayStation 4 does not allow for cross-progression.",

In the tradition of classic MMOs, the game provides players with both open-world and dungeon experiences, for both solo players and parties. Players can also take part in various kinds of PvP, if that’s the thing that interests them, including battles in the Coliseum, or warfare between three factions on the grand battlefield.

Featuring everything players would expect from a battle royale game – the shrinking map, collecting equipment, and the fight to be the last player standing – TABG is different in that it features a physics engine that produces all kinds of wobbly effects. In fact, the devs seem to feel the wobblier the better.

Originally intended as an April Fool’s Day joke, the game was a spinoff of Landfall’s Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. Of course, it’s prank origins results in some rather silly gameplay scenarios, such as players slapping each other to death. The game also offers other unique features like dual-wielding.

Gameplay is focused around payload-style matches. In order to win, the Drifters must move a payload to their ship at the opposite end of the map, while avoiding being destroyed by the opposing team. As one of the payloads gets closer to its destination, conflicts become more frequent as the opposing team respawns near the end. During play, players can earn accumulated loot by breaking open chests or killing roaming minions. Gathering this loot earns in-match credits that are  used to level up a Drifter. ",
